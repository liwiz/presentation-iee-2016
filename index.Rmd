## Objectives

After attending this presentation, the participant will

- Appreciate the **potential** of social media tools in delivering content to learners
- Recognize the capabilities and **limitations** of social media metrics in data analysis

<aside class="notes">
I hope you will appreciate the potential and limitations of social media in education.

<aside class="notes">
... but you may be less familiar with the concept of the Facebook Page (with a capital "P"), which is different from your regular Facebook Profile. Basically, any organization or individual craving attention can create a Facebook Page for the express purpose of self promotion. Other users can then "Like" the Page to start receiving updates. So when Taylor Swift says happy birthday to her friend, all of her 74 million Fans will this. (By the way, in Facebook lingo, Fans are those who have Liked a Page.) Speaking of 74 million Fans, when you run a Page you get detailed metrics such as how many people saw a post and how many people clicked on it.

<aside class="notes">
What all this means is that a Facebook Page has the power to reach hundreds, thousands, or millions of people at once, and this reach is *measurable*. This is the kind of power we want to harness for education---specifically, the education of anatomy and radiology.

## Anatomy + Radiology

<span style="font-size: 125%;">Radiology: the way most physicians see anatomy</span>

<aside class="notes">
Anatomy-radiology integration is frequently discussed, and it makes sense from the perspective of multi-modality learning and clinical thinking. Radiology is how most physicians see anatomy, unless they are surgeons or pathologists.

## <span style="color: red;">Pull</span> Learning: <br><small>Significant Effort Required</small>

TeamRads: separate, non-integrated site

- "Yet another system"
- "Go to Section X, click on Case Y..."
- Challenge to patience and willpower

. . . 

Need to **invert** the flow of educational resources

<aside class="notes">
We are making students engage in what I call "pull learning," where significant effort is required to see the learning material.

Technology makes it worse. Students complain about Blackboard because it takes way too many clicks to log into JHED, launch Blackboard, find the course link, click "Course Materials," open several layers of folders, download the file, and then open the file. It's insanity.

TeamRads contributes to the same problem. It's yet another system to click through when students are told to go to Section X, click on Case Y. The content can't be downloaded. Even *I*, one of the Webmasters of TeamRads, dread it when I have to go on TeamRads to find something specific.

Clearly, we need to change the learning paradigm. We need to invert the flow of educational resources.
</aside>

## <span style="color: red;">Push</span> Learning

<aside class="notes">
We need to create "push learning."
</aside>

## Goals

<span style="color: red;">**Push**</span> daily imaging cases *in step* with anatomy curriculum, directly into the hands of students

- Drive learning on *all* devices
    * Computer
    * Phone
    * Tablet
- Reinforce both anatomy and radiology
- Foster and measure student engagement
- Set up once, run automatically

<aside class="notes">
Specifically, with this project, we want to [slide contents]

## Target Demographic

Students in JHUSOM Human Anatomy course:

- Medical
- Biomedical Engineering
- Medical & Biological Illustration

*N* â‰ˆ 140 each year, voluntary participation

Project done twice, 2014 and 2015

<aside class="notes">
Obviously, we are targeting students in the anatomy class. Participation is voluntary. Of note, we ran the project twice, in 2014 and in 2015.

<aside class="notes">
... what is extremely useful is the ability to write a bunch of posts ahead of time, save them into a queue, and then set the exact schedule by which these posts go live. That's the reason the tool is called Buffer.

![Case workflow through Buffer](img/buffer-workflow.png){height=550px}

All cases are carefully de-identified

<aside class="notes">
Here is our workflow. We put together a series of imaging cases closely correlated with the day-to-day anatomy curriculum. We save the cases to Buffer and set Buffer to post these cases to our Facebook Page every weekday.
</aside>

## Structural Limitations

- Not everyone uses Facebook
- Previous year's participants not excluded
- Facebook Page is public; anyone could participate
- Extra participants counted in Facebook's metrics

<aside class="notes">
Let me be up front with the limitations inherent to this approach. Not everyone uses Facebook. When we ran the project again in 2015, we found that there was no easy way to just boot off everybody from 2014 and start over. I imagine that Facebook is more concerned with you getting more Fans as opposed to you controlling exactly who your Fans are. In the same fashion, because a Facebook Page is public, anyone outside our target demographic could become a Fan and participate. All these "extra people" are counted in Facebook's metrics, giving us an inflated sense of actual engagement.
</aside>

----

![Facebook Fan demographics screenshot](img/demographics.png){height=650px}

<aside class="notes">
To illustrate, on the demographics data of our Fans from 2014, you can see that we have a number of people clearly not from Baltimore or even from the United States.
</aside>

----

![](fig/metrics-views14.png){height=650px}

<aside class="notes">
Anyway, here are the actual usage data. Shown here are the number of Fans we had (total and online) and the number of views we got for each day that we posted a case in 2014. The y-axis is unique users to avoid multiple counting. Note that on some days we had more views from unique users than the actual number of Fans. It's a bit of an unexpected finding. We think that Facebook shows our Page to those who are not our Fans to maximize our exposure and attract more fans. That kind of algorithm is good for Taylor Swift but maybe not so good for our purposes.
</aside>

----

![](fig/metrics-clicks14.png){height=650px}

<aside class="notes">
It is also interesting to see that, despite all those views, only a small percentage of people (around 10% of views) actually clicked on the links to the imaging cases.
</aside>

----

![](fig/metrics-views15.png){height=650px}

<aside class="notes">
Here is our 2015 data. Same basic patterns, except a lot more Fans than views this time. Perhaps most of the people from 2014 are ignoring us.
</aside>

----

![](fig/metrics-clicks15.png){height=650px}

<aside class="notes">
Again, a lot of views but not a lot of link clicks.
</aside>

----

![](fig/feedback-pct.png){height=650px}

<aside class="notes">
At the end of each year, when we asked those in our target demographic what they thought of this project, more than 70% of responders each year agreed that the cases increased their understanding of anatomy and increased their appreciation of imaging as a diagnostic tool. They also agreed that the cases were interesting, the user interface was intuitive, and that the material chosen was relevant. Responses were mixed as to whether cases increased the desire to explore radiology as a career. I did not expect to convert students that easily to radiology.

## Limitations

<div style="color: gray;">
- Not everyone uses Facebook
- Previous year's participants not excluded
- Facebook Page is public; anyone could participate
- Extra participants counted in Facebook's metrics
</div>

. . .

- Facebook's algorithm may *broaden* content's visibility
    * Possibly undesirable in controlled environment
- Participants free to ignore content pushed
- Currently unable to directly assess learning enhancement
    
## Future Directions

- **Reach**: Find additional avenues of content delivery
- **Control**: Consider limiting content to target demographic
    * Closed group may conflict with openness philosophy
- **Quality**: Improve imaging cases
- **Responsibility**: Incorporate testing to assess impact

<aside class="notes">
Future directions: basically increase reach, control, quality, and responsibility -- all those buzzwords.
</aside>

## Conclusions

Facebook and Buffer

- **Powerful**: <span style="color: red;">Push</span> learning with broad reach
- **Information-rich**: Highly revealing metrics
- **Natural** for users: Fits habits of Digital Natives
- **Simple** for administrators: Set up once, run repeatedly


Well received by students

Widely applicable to other educational scenarios

<aside class="notes">
As for our conclusions, more buzzwords. The Facebook and Buffer technique is powerful, information-rich, natural for users, and simple for administrators. It is well received by students and widely applicable to other educational scenarios.
