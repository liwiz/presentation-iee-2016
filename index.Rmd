<aside class="notes">
... but you may be less familiar with the concept of the Facebook Page (with a capital "P"), which is different from your regular Facebook Profile. Basically, any organization or individual craving attention, in this case Taylor Swift, can create a Facebook Page for the express purpose of self promotion. Other users don't "Friend" this organization or person; instead, they "Like" the Page to start receiving updates. (In Facebook parlance, a "Fan" is a user who has "Liked" a Page.) So when Taylor Swift says happy birthday to her friend, all of her 74 million Fans can see this. Speaking of 74 million Fans, when you run a Page you can see detailed metrics such as how many people saw the post, how many people clicked on it, and so forth.

<aside class="notes">
What all this means is that a Facebook Page has the power to reach hundreds, thousands, or millions of people at once, and this reach is *measurable*. This is the kind of power we want to harness for education---in our case, the education of anatomy and radiology.

## Anatomy + Radiology

![Thieme Anatomy figure](img/anatomy.png){width=40%} ![CT angiogram](img/radiology.png){width=40%}

. . . 

<span style="font-size: 125%;">Radiology: the way most physicians see anatomy</span>

<aside class="notes">
Anatomy-radiology correlation is frequently discussed, and it makes sense. It fosters multi-modality learning, highlights clinical relevance, and may possibly promote an early interest in radiology. It is also important to remember that, aside from surgeons and pathologists, most physicians see anatomy through the perspective of radiology.

## <span style="color: red;">Pull</span> Learning: <br><small>Significant Effort Required</small>

TeamRads: separate, non-integrated site

- "Yet another system"
- "Go to Section X, click on Case Y..."
- Challenge to patience and willpower

. . . 

Need to **invert** the flow of educational resources

<aside class="notes">
We are making students engage in what I call "pull learning," where they have to spend significant effort to bring learning materials to the front of their consciousness.

Technology often doesn't make it easier. Students complain about Blackboard because it takes way too many clicks to log into JHED, launch Blackboard, find the course link, click "Course Materials," open several layers of folders, download the file, and then open the file. It's insanity; I'd rather have a single binder in front of me.

TeamRads contributes to the same problem. It's yet another system to click through when students are told to go to Section X, click on Case Y. It's not as easy as a Google search, and the content can't be downloaded. As one of the Webmasters of TeamRads, *I* dread it when I have to go on TeamRads to find something specific.

We need to change the learning paradigm. We need to invert the flow of educational resources.

## <span style="color: red;">Push</span> Learning

<aside class="notes">
We need to create "push learning."
</aside>

## Goals

<span style="color: red;">**Push**</span> daily imaging cases *in step* with anatomy curriculum, directly into the hands of students

- Learning on multiple devices
    * Computer
    * Phone
    * Tablet
- Reinforce high-yield anatomic relationships
- Reinforce key concepts in image interpretation
- Set up once, deliver automatically
- Foster and measure student engagement

<aside class="notes">
We created a Facebook Page, *JH Team Rads*, and we encouraged our target demographic to "Like" the Page.
</aside>

----

![Notification with new content](img/notification.png)

<aside class="notes">
You know what happens after that: whenever we post an imaging case, our Fans receive a push notification on their phones, tablets, and computers the instant it happens.
</aside>

----

![Buffer logo](https://cdn.searchenginejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/buffer-text-1024-white-bg.jpg)

<aside class="notes">
Now, Buffer is the linchpin in all this.
</aside>

----

![Buffer integrations](img/buffer-integrations.png)

<aside class="notes">
Buffer is a Web application that manages social media accounts. One function is to post to multiple social networks at once, which at the moment we are just posting to Facebook.
</aside>

----

![Buffer post scheduling screenshot](img/buffer-schedule.png)

<aside class="notes">
But what we find extremely useful is the ability to write a bunch of posts ahead of time, save them into a queue, and then set the exact schedule by which these posts go live.
</aside>

----

![Case workflow through Buffer](img/buffer-workflow.png){height=550px}

All cases are carefully de-identified

<aside class="notes">
So here is our workflow. We put together a series of imaging cases that correlate well with the day-by-day anatomy curriculum. We stored the cases in the correct order in Buffer, and we set Buffer to post the cases to our Facebook Page every weekday.
</aside>

## Structural Limitations

- Not everyone uses Facebook
- Previous year's participants not excluded
- Facebook Page is public; anyone could participate
- Facebook's metrics track extra participants

<aside class="notes">
Let me be up front with the limitations inherent to this approach. Not everyone uses Facebook; some prefers not to at certain times. When we ran the project again in 2015, we found that there was no easy way to just boot off everybody from 2014 and start over. I imagine that Facebook is more concerned with you getting more Fans as opposed to you controlling exactly who your Fans are. In the same fashion, because a Facebook Page is public, anyone outside our target demographic could become a Fan and participate. All these "extra people" are counted in Facebook's metrics, giving us a flawed sense of actual engagement.
</aside>

----

![Facebook Fan demographics screenshot](img/demographics.png){height=650px}

<aside class="notes">
In fact, here are the demographics data of our Fans from 2014. Note that we have a number of people clearly not from Baltimore or even from the United States.
</aside>

----

![](fig/metrics-views14.png){height=650px}

<aside class="notes">
Now, let me show you some hard data. Here are the number of Fans we had and the number of views we got for each day we posted a case. [Explain legend.] Note that the y-axis is unique users, so if someone views the Page multiple times it only gets counted once. It is quite apparent that on some days we have many more Page views from unique users than the actual number of Fans. We think this is due to Facebook trying to maximize the Page's exposure, where Facebook users who are not our Fans (but maybe who are Friends of our Fans) are also shown our posts.
</aside>

----

![](fig/metrics-clicks14.png){height=650px}

<aside class="notes">
It is also interesting to see that, despite all the views we got, only a small percentage of people actually clicked on the links to the imaging cases.
</aside>

![](fig/metrics-clicks-pct14.png){height=650px}

<aside class="notes">
Here is the plot that shows link clicks as a percentage of Page views in 2014.
</aside>

----

![](fig/metrics-views15.png){height=650px}

<aside class="notes">
Here is our 2015 data. We see the same basic patterns, except that there are a lot more Fans than views this time. Perhaps most of the people from 2014 are ignoring us.
</aside>
----

![](fig/metrics-clicks15.png){height=650px}

<aside class="notes">
Again, a lot of views but not a lot of link clicks.

Link click percentages are shown here.

![](fig/feedback-pct.png){height=650px}

<aside class="notes">
When we asked our students, those within our target demographic, each year what they thought of this project, more than 70% of responders each year agreed that the cases increased their understanding of anatomy and increased their appreciation of imaging as a diagnostic tool. They also agreed that the cases were interesting, the user interface was intuitive, and that the material chosen was relevant. Responses were mixed as to whether cases increased the desire to explore radiology as a career. I did not expect to convince students that easily, anyway.

## Limitations

<div style="color: gray;">
- Not everyone uses Facebook
- Previous year's participants not excluded
- Facebook Page is public; anyone could participate
- Facebook's metrics track extra participants
</div>

. . .

- Facebook algorithm may limit *and* broaden audience of content
    * Neither desirable in controlled environment
- Participants free to ignore content being delivered
- Currently unable to directly assess learning enhancement
    
## Future Directions

- **Reach**: Find additional mechanisms of case delivery
    * Other social networks
    * Non - social media channels
- **Control**: Consider limiting content accessibility strictly to target demographic
    * "Tighter" metrics
    * Creation of closed group may conflict with openness
- **Quality**: Continue to improve and add imaging cases
- **Connection**: Link cases to related cases or tutorials
- **Responsibility**: Incorporate testing to assess educational impact

## Conclusions

- Facebook and Buffer: powerful, information-rich, and synergistic tools
    * **<span style="color: red;">Push</span> learning** integrated with daily habits
    * Simplified administration with scheduled posts
    * Highly revealing participation metrics
    * *Caution: content reach may not be what is intended*

. . .

- Well received by students
    * Interesting, relevant cases
    * Greater understanding of both anatomy and radiology
    * Increased appreciation of imaging

. . .

Widely applicable to other educational scenarios
