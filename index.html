… but you may be less familiar with the concept of the Facebook Page (with a capital “P”), which is different from your regular Facebook Profile. Basically, any organization or individual craving attention can create a Facebook Page for the express purpose of self promotion. Other users can then “Like” the Page to start receiving updates. So when Taylor Swift says happy birthday to her friend, all of her 74 million Fans will this. (By the way, in Facebook lingo, Fans are those who have Liked a Page.) Speaking of 74 million Fans, when you run a Page you get detailed metrics such as how many people saw a post and how many people clicked on it.

What all this means is that a Facebook Page has the power to reach hundreds, thousands, or millions of people at once, and this reach is <em>measurable</em>. This is the kind of power we want to harness for education—specifically, the education of anatomy and radiology.

<aside class="notes">
<p>We are making students engage in what I call “pull learning,” where significant effort is required to see the learning material.</p>
<p>Technology makes it worse. Students complain about Blackboard because it takes way too many clicks to log into JHED, launch Blackboard, find the course link, click “Course Materials,” open several layers of folders, download the file, and then open the file. It’s insanity.</p>
<p>TeamRads contributes to the same problem. It’s yet another system to click through when students are told to go to Section X, click on Case Y. The content can’t be downloaded. Even <em>I</em>, one of the Webmasters of TeamRads, dread it when I have to go on TeamRads to find something specific.</p>
Clearly, we need to change the learning paradigm. We need to invert the flow of educational resources.

<section id="structural-limitations" class="slide level2">
<h1>Structural Limitations</h1>
<ul>
<li>Not everyone uses Facebook</li>
<li>Previous year’s participants not excluded</li>
<li>Facebook Page is public; anyone could participate</li>
<li>Extra participants counted in Facebook’s metrics</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
Let me be up front with the limitations inherent to this approach. Not everyone uses Facebook. When we ran the project again in 2015, we found that there was no easy way to just boot off everybody from 2014 and start over. I imagine that Facebook is more concerned with you getting more Fans as opposed to you controlling exactly who your Fans are. In the same fashion, because a Facebook Page is public, anyone outside our target demographic could become a Fan and participate. All these “extra people” are counted in Facebook’s metrics, giving us an inflated sense of actual engagement.
</aside>
</section>
<section class="slide level2">

<p><img src="img/demographics.png" alt="Facebook Fan demographics screenshot" height="650" /></p>
<aside class="notes">
To illustrate, on the demographics data of our Fans from 2014, you can see that we have a number of people clearly not from Baltimore or even from the United States.
</aside>
</section>
<section class="slide level2">

<p><img src="fig/metrics-views14.png" height="650" /></p>
<aside class="notes">
Anyway, here are the actual usage data. Shown here are the number of Fans we had (total and online) and the number of views we got for each day that we posted a case in 2014. The y-axis is unique users to avoid multiple counting. Note that on some days we had more views from unique users than the actual number of Fans. It’s a bit of an unexpected finding. We think that Facebook shows our Page to those who are not our Fans to maximize our exposure and attract more fans. That kind of algorithm is good for Taylor Swift but maybe not so good for our purposes.
</aside>
</section>
<section class="slide level2">

<p><img src="fig/metrics-clicks14.png" height="650" /></p>

It is also interesting to see that, despite all those views, only a small percentage of people (around 10% of views) actually clicked on the links to the imaging cases.

<p><img src="fig/metrics-views15.png" height="650" /></p>

Here is our 2015 data. Same basic patterns, except a lot more Fans than views this time. Perhaps most of the people from 2014 are ignoring us.

<section class="slide level2">

<p><img src="fig/metrics-clicks15.png" height="650" /></p>

<p><img src="fig/feedback-pct.png" height="650" /></p>
<aside class="notes">
At the end of each year, when we asked those in our target demographic what they thought of this project, more than 70% of responders each year agreed that the cases increased their understanding of anatomy and increased their appreciation of imaging as a diagnostic tool. They also agreed that the cases were interesting, the user interface was intuitive, and that the material chosen was relevant. Responses were mixed as to whether cases increased the desire to explore radiology as a career. I did not expect to convert students that easily to radiology.
